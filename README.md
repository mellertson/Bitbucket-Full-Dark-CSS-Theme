# Bitbucket-Full-Dark-CSS-Theme
[Bitbucket Full Dark][1] theme for the [Stylish][2] browser plugin.  

This theme is based on Bejamin Bagley's excellent "Jira Dark Flat" theme, which I re-tooled
in this theme for Bitbucket.

If you find any display issues with this theme, please consider submitting a pull request.

Enjoy!
